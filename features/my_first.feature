Feature: Running a test
  As an iOS developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps
  Given I am on the Welcome Screen
  When I tap the bet book
  Then the book opens and I am taken to the bet page
  When I tap the add bet button
  Then I can enter a new bet
  When I add a new bet for $5 and click the save button
  Then The bet is added to my bet book
